# E-commerce-Campaign-Funnel-Analysis-SQL-BigQuery-GA4
Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete workflow of digital marketing analytics combined with eCommerce user behavior insights.

The analysis is based on:

- advertising campaign data from Google Ads and Facebook Ads stored in PostgreSQL

- user interaction events exported from Google Analytics 4 into BigQuery.

Key focus areas include:


- evaluation of marketing spend, efficiency, and ROMI


- building a sales funnel covering the entire journey from session start to purchase


- conversion rate analysis across traffic sources, dates, and landing pages


- exploring correlations between user engagement metrics and purchasing behavior

  

Project Goals

- generate detailed performance insights for advertising campaigns
  
- detect the main drop-off stages within the sales funnel
- develop SQL queries optimized for BI dashboard integration
- strengthen skills with advanced PostgreSQL and BigQuery queries

Objectives:
- Calculate average, minimum, and maximum daily spend for Google and Facebook Ads
- Identify top-5 days by ROMI
- Determine the campaign with the highest weekly value
- Find the largest month-over-month reach increase

Task 2: GA4 Data Preparation in BigQuery

Source: Public GA4 eCommerce dataset (2021)
Objectives:

- Extract events: session_start, view_item, add_to_cart, begin_checkout, add_shipping_info, add_payment_info, purchase
- Keep dimensions: timestamp, users, sessions, country, device, traffic source, campaign name

  
Task 3: Conversion Calculations

Goal: Build a conversion funnel (from session start to purchase) by date, source, medium, campaign.

Metrics:

- visit_to_checkout
- visit_to_purchase

  
Task 4: Landing Page Conversion Comparison

Source: GA4 dataset (2020)

Objectives:
